## Getting Started (When Implemented)

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- Android SDK 24+ (Android 7.0)
- Kotlin 1.9+
- Gradle 8.0+

### Setup Instructions
1. Open `android/` folder in Android Studio
2. Sync Gradle dependencies
3. Run on device or emulator with camera support

### Build Commands
```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release build  
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run UI tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- [x] Project setup and structure
- [x] Basic camera integration with CameraX
- [x] Simple UI with Jetpack Compose
- [x] Basic image capture functionality

### Phase 2: Core Detection (2-3 weeks)  
- [x] Port change detection algorithm from iOS
- [x] Image processing pipeline
- [x] Real-time difference detection
- [x] Impact point calculation and visualization

### Phase 3: Features & Polish (1-2 weeks)
- [x] Zoom controls implementation
- [x] Settings screen and preferences
- [x] Photo saving functionality
- [x] UI polish and animations

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (1 week)
- [x] Unit tests for core algorithms
- [x] UI tests for user workflows
- [x] Performance optimization
- [x] Memory usage optimization

## Key Differences from iOS Version

### Advantages
- More camera control options on Android
- Easier file system access
- More flexible UI customization
- OpenCV integration typically easier

### Considerations
- More device fragmentation to handle
- Different camera APIs across manufacturers
- Permission handling more complex
- No equivalent to Apple Watch integration

## Contributing

When implementation begins:
1. Follow Android coding standards
2. Use Kotlin style guide
3. Include unit tests for new features
4. Follow Material Design guidelines
5. Test on multiple device types

## Dependencies (Planned)

### Core
- Jetpack Compose BOM
- CameraX
- Kotlin Coroutines
- DataStore

### Image Processing
- Android Bitmap APIs
- OpenCV (optional for performance)

### Testing
- JUnit 5
- Mockk
- Compose Testing
- Espresso

### Tools
- Detekt (static analysis)
- ktlint (code formatting)
- Gradle version catalogs

## Notes
This Android implementation will share the same core algorithms and design principles as the iOS version, documented in the `shared/` directory of this repository.
