# Image Processing Pipeline

## Overview
Image processing operations for camera feed handling and target analysis.

## Core Operations

### 1. Image Rotation
**Purpose:** Correct camera orientation for display and processing

**iOS Implementation:**
- 90-degree clockwise rotation using `CGContext`
- Transforms: translate → rotate → scale → draw
- Maintains aspect ratio and image quality

**Android Implementation (Future):**
- Use `Matrix.postRotate()` with `Canvas.drawBitmap()`
- Similar transformation pipeline

### 2. Image Scaling
**Purpose:** Optimize performance and memory usage

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Target size: 200x200 pixels for processing
- Maintain aspect ratio
- Use high-quality interpolation

**Implementation Notes:**
- Scale down large images before difference detection
- Keep original for final output and saving

### 3. Color Space Conversion
**Purpose:** Consistent color analysis across devices

**Approach:**
- Ensure RGB color space for all processing
- Handle device-specific color profiles
- Normalize color values to 0-255 range

### 4. Image Compression
**Purpose:** Efficient storage and transmission (Watch integration)

**Parameters:**
- JPEG quality: 0.3 for Watch transmission
- Size limit: 60KB for WatchConnectivity
- Fallback: Further compression if needed

## Quality Considerations

### Lighting Adaptation
- Algorithm should work in various lighting conditions
- Consider auto-exposure compensation
- May need dynamic threshold adjustment

### Motion Blur Handling
- Fast camera movements can cause blur
- Consider motion detection before processing
- Stabilization algorithms may be beneficial

### Calibration
- Allow users to calibrate for their specific setup
- Distance-dependent scaling factors
- Environmental condition adjustments

## Platform-Specific Notes

### iOS
- `UIGraphicsImageRenderer` for high-quality operations
- `AVFoundation` for camera integration
- Core Image filters for advanced processing

### Android (Future)
- `Canvas` and `Paint` for drawing operations
- `CameraX` for camera integration  
- RenderScript or OpenCV for performance

## Performance Optimization
- Process smaller image regions when possible
- Use background threading for heavy operations
- Cache processed results when appropriate
- Monitor memory usage with large images
