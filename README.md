A multi-platform bullet impact detection system for target shooting practice.

## Overview

Live Target helps shooting enthusiasts automatically detect and track bullet impacts on targets using computer vision. The system provides real-time visual feedback and can save annotated target images for analysis.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Features |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **iOS** | âœ… **Active Development** | Camera, Detection, Settings, Watch Integration |
| **watchOS** | âœ… **Active Development** | Impact Display, History, Haptic Feedback |
| **Android** | ðŸ“‹ **Planned** | Camera, Detection, Settings (No Watch) |

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time camera feed** with live impact detection
- **Automatic bullet impact detection** using computer vision
- **Visual impact indicators** with numbered circles
- **Configurable detection sensitivity** for different bullet calibers
- **Photo saving** with impact annotations
- **Zoom controls** for precise targeting

### iOS-Specific Features
- **Apple Watch integration** with impact notifications
- **Haptic feedback** on Watch for new impacts  
- **SwiftUI native interface** following iOS design guidelines
- **Background processing** for optimal performance

### Planned Android Features
- **Material Design 3 interface** following Android guidelines
- **CameraX integration** for modern camera handling
- **OpenCV acceleration** for improved performance
- **Flexible file system access** for image management

## Getting Started

### iOS Development

#### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0+ / watchOS 10.0+
- Apple Developer account (for device testing)
- Physical iPhone with camera

#### Setup
```bash
# Navigate to iOS project
cd ios/

# Open in Xcode
open "Live Target.xcodeproj"

# Or build from command line
../tools/scripts/build-ios.sh
```

### Android Development (Future)
```bash
# Navigate to Android project (when available)
cd android/

# Build with Gradle
../tools/scripts/build-android.sh
```

## How It Works

### Detection Algorithm
1. **Continuous camera capture** at configurable intervals
2. **Image comparison** between consecutive frames
3. **Pixel-level difference detection** with adjustable thresholds  
4. **Region grouping** using flood-fill algorithm
5. **Impact point calculation** from region centroids
6. **Size filtering** based on bullet caliber settings

### Technical Implementation
- **Computer vision** using native platform APIs
- **Background processing** for real-time performance
- **Normalized coordinates** for device-independent accuracy
- **Throttled detection** to balance accuracy and performance

For detailed technical documentation, see [`shared/docs/architecture.md`](shared/docs/architecture.md).

## Configuration

### Detection Settings
- **Bullet Caliber:** 17-70 (affects minimum detection size)
- **Check Frequency:** 0.5-10.0 seconds between comparisons
- **Color Customization:** Impact circle and number colors
- **Zoom Levels:** 1x to 10x camera zoom

### Performance Tuning
- **Lower check frequency** for better battery life
- **Higher caliber settings** to reduce false positives
- **Zoom adjustment** for optimal target visibility

## Testing

### iOS Testing
```bash
cd ios/
xcodebuild test -project "Live Target.xcodeproj" -scheme "Live Target" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16"
```

### Test Coverage
- **Unit tests** for core detection algorithms
- **Integration tests** for camera functionality  
- **UI tests** for user workflows
- **Performance tests** for real-time processing

See test files in `ios/Live TargetTests/` for detailed test coverage.

## Contributing

### Development Workflow
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create feature branch** from `main`
3. **Implement changes** following platform guidelines
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Submit pull request** with detailed description

### Code Standards
- **iOS:** SwiftLint configuration in `ios/.swiftlint.yml`
- **Android:** Detekt + ktlint (when implemented)
- **Documentation:** Update relevant docs in `shared/`
- **Testing:** Maintain test coverage for new features

### Platform Guidelines
- **iOS:** Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- **Android:** Follow Material Design principles  
- **Shared:** Document algorithms and design decisions

## Architecture

The system uses a **shared documentation approach** with **platform-optimized implementations**:

- **Core algorithms** documented in `shared/algorithms/`
- **Design system** specified in `shared/design/`
- **Platform implementations** optimized for each ecosystem
- **Common CI/CD** workflows for both platforms

This approach allows for:
- **Consistent user experience** across platforms
- **Platform-specific optimizations** for best performance
- **Shared learning** and algorithm improvements
- **Independent release cycles** per platform

## Security

This project includes comprehensive security monitoring:
- **Automated dependency scanning** with Dependabot
- **Weekly security audits** for vulnerabilities
- **Secret detection** in code reviews
- **Secure CI/CD pipeline** with proper permissions
