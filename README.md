# Live Target

Live Target is an iOS application that uses your phoneâ€™s camera to monitor a physical target (paper or steel) and automatically registers hits when visual changes are detected. When a hit is detected, Live Target will:

âœ… Draw a **red circle** around the detected impact  
âœ… Number the hit for tracking shot sequence  
âœ… Store and display shot history for review

### Apple Watch Companion

If you have an Apple Watch, Live Target includes a companion app that shows:

- The **latest image** of your target with the latest hit circled
- Shot sequence numbers at a glance on your wrist
- Quick reference while on the range without needing to check your phone

### Features (Planned)

- Live camera monitoring of targets for hit detection
- Hit marking with automatic numbering
- Target image history with hit overlays
- Apple Watch live sync
- Optional shot timer integration
- Local and iCloud history storage

### Tech Stack

- Swift / SwiftUI (iOS + watchOS)
- AVFoundation (camera integration)
- CoreML / Vision (optional advanced hit detection in future)
- CoreData or CloudKit for data persistence
