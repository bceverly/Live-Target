```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common iOS Issues

**Xcode Command Line Tools Issues:**
```bash
# Reset command line tools
sudo xcode-select --reset
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

**SwiftLint SourceKit Crashes:**
```bash
# Reinstall SwiftLint
brew uninstall swiftlint
brew install swiftlint

# Or use GitHub Actions for reliable linting
git push  # Triggers CI/CD with SwiftLint
```

**Simulator Issues:**
```bash
# Reset iOS Simulator
xcrun simctl erase all

# List available simulators
xcrun simctl list devices
```

**Build Cache Issues:**
```bash
# Clean Xcode build cache
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

# Clean project in Xcode: Product > Clean Build Folder (‚åò+Shift+K)
```

#### Common Android Issues

**Gradle Issues:**
```bash
# Clean Gradle cache
./gradlew clean

# Refresh dependencies
./gradlew --refresh-dependencies
```

**SDK Issues:**
```bash
# Update SDK tools via Android Studio
# Tools > SDK Manager > Update
```

**Samsung Galaxy Watch Issues:**
```bash
# Check Samsung Accessory SDK integration
./gradlew build --info | grep "samsung"

# Verify watch connection
# Check Samsung Galaxy Wearable app on phone
# Ensure watch and phone are paired
# Test with watch integration toggle in app settings
```

**Watch Connection Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure Galaxy Watch is paired and connected via Samsung Galaxy Wearable app
- Check Bluetooth connectivity between phone and watch
- Verify watch is unlocked and within range
- Restart Samsung Accessory Service if connection fails
- Check app permissions for Samsung Accessory framework

### Hardware Requirements

#### iOS Development
- **Mac computer** (MacBook, iMac, Mac Studio, Mac Pro)
- **8GB RAM minimum** (16GB+ recommended for Xcode)
- **50GB free disk space** (for Xcode, iOS SDK, simulators)
- **iPhone device** for camera functionality testing
- **Apple Watch** (optional, for Watch app testing)

#### Android Development
- **Any computer** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **8GB RAM minimum** (16GB+ recommended for Android Studio)
- **30GB free disk space** (for Android Studio, SDK, emulators)
- **Android device** for camera functionality testing
- **Samsung Galaxy Watch** (optional, Series 4+ for watch integration testing)

### Getting Started

## How It Works

### Detection Algorithm
1. **Continuous camera capture** at configurable intervals
2. **Image comparison** between consecutive frames
3. **Pixel-level difference detection** with adjustable thresholds  
4. **Region grouping** using flood-fill algorithm
5. **Impact point calculation** from region centroids
6. **Size filtering** based on bullet caliber settings

### Technical Implementation
- **Computer vision** using native platform APIs
- **Background processing** for real-time performance
- **Normalized coordinates** for device-independent accuracy
- **Throttled detection** to balance accuracy and performance

For detailed technical documentation, see [`shared/docs/architecture.md`](shared/docs/architecture.md).

## Configuration

### Detection Settings
- **Bullet Caliber:** 17-70 (affects minimum detection size)
- **Check Frequency:** 0.5-10.0 seconds between comparisons
- **Color Customization:** Impact circle and number colors
- **Zoom Levels:** 1x to 10x camera zoom

### Performance Tuning
- **Lower check frequency** for better battery life
- **Higher caliber settings** to reduce false positives
- **Zoom adjustment** for optimal target visibility

## Testing

### iOS Testing
```bash
cd ios/
xcodebuild test -project "Live Target.xcodeproj" -scheme "Live Target" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16"
```

### Test Coverage
- **Unit tests** for core detection algorithms
- **Integration tests** for camera functionality  
- **UI tests** for user workflows
- **Performance tests** for real-time processing

See test files in `ios/Live TargetTests/` for detailed test coverage.

## Local CI/CD Testing

### Setting Up Local CI/CD with act

To catch CI/CD issues before pushing to GitHub, you can run the GitHub Actions locally using `act`:

#### Installation
```bash
# Install act (GitHub Actions local runner)
brew install act

# Install Docker Desktop (required for act)
brew install --cask docker

# Start Docker Desktop
open -a Docker
```

#### Running Local CI/CD
```bash
# Run all CI/CD checks locally (recommended before every push)
./scripts/local-ci.sh

# Run specific GitHub Actions workflows
act push                    # Run all push workflows
act -j lint-and-test       # Run Android lint and test job
act -j build              # Run Android build job

# Run with specific event
act pull_request           # Run PR checks

# List available workflows
act -l
```

#### Local CI/CD Script
The `scripts/local-ci.sh` script runs the same checks as GitHub Actions:

- ‚úÖ **Android lint** (`gradlew lintDebug`)
- ‚úÖ **Android unit tests** (`gradlew testDebugUnitTest`)
- ‚úÖ **Android build** (`gradlew assembleDebug`)
- ‚úÖ **iOS build** (`xcodebuild build`) *if Xcode available*
- ‚úÖ **iOS unit tests** (`xcodebuild test`) *if Xcode available*
- ‚úÖ **SwiftLint** (`swiftlint`) *if installed*
- ‚úÖ **Security scan** (secret detection)

#### Quick Check Commands
```bash
# Android only
cd android && ./gradlew lintDebug testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug

# iOS only (if Xcode installed)
cd ios && xcodebuild -project "Live Target.xcodeproj" -scheme "Live Target" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15" build test

# Full local CI/CD
./scripts/local-ci.sh
```

### Benefits of Local CI/CD

- üöÄ **Faster feedback** - catch issues before pushing
- üí∞ **Save CI minutes** - reduce failed builds in GitHub Actions
- üîí **Security** - detect secrets and vulnerabilities locally
- üõ°Ô∏è **Quality** - ensure code passes all checks before PR

### CI/CD Configuration

The project includes comprehensive CI/CD pipelines:

- **`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`** - Main orchestration workflow
- **`.github/workflows/android-ci.yml`** - Android-specific pipeline
- **`.github/workflows/ios-ci.yml`** - iOS-specific pipeline
